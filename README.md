# Clean Bot Project

This project provides a modular, SOLID-compliant framework for reading data from an Intel RealSense D435i camera and either publishing it to ROS 2 topics or saving it to a ROS 2 bag file.

## Structure

- `sense/reader.py` ‚Äî CameraReader class for reading frames from the camera
- `store/bagstorage.py` ‚Äî BagStorage class for saving frames to a ROS 2 bag file
- `ros_publisher.py` ‚Äî RosPublisher class for publishing frames to a ROS topic
- `main.py` ‚Äî Main entry point; run with `-bag` to save to bag, or without to publish to ROS

## Installation

1. Install system dependencies (for ROS 2 and RealSense):
   ```sh
   sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-rclpy ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-sensor-msgs ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-cv-bridge
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- **Publish camera data to ROS 2 topic:**
  ```sh
  python3 main.py
  ```
- **Save camera data to a ROS 2 bag file:**
  ```sh
  python3 main.py -bag
  ```

## Extending
- Add new camera readers or storage backends by following the interface in `sense/reader.py` and `store/bagstorage.py`.
- The code is organized for easy testing and extension.

# Clean Bot Simulation with ROS 2 Jazzy and Gazebo Harmonic

Use this as a starting point of development, it includes a basic ROS2 package structure with an example chassis frame that can be extended upon.  
**Note:** Releases that I am using are **ROS 2 Jazzy (LTS)** and **Gazebo Harmonic (LTS)**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Source ROS 2 Installation**

   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
   ```

2. **Create a Workspace**

   Create a directory with a name of your choice (e.g., `clean_bot_ws`) and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/clean_bot_ws/src
   cd ~/clean_bot_ws/src
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository **inside the `src/` folder** (this is important):

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

4. **Build the Workspace**

   Move to the root of the workspace and build it:

   ```bash
   cd ..
   colcon build --symlink-install
   ```

5. **Source the Workspace**

   ```bash
   source ./install/setup.bash
   ```

## üöÄ Running the Simulation

1. **Run the Robot State Publisher**

   ```bash
   ros2 launch clean_bot rsp.launch.py
   ```

2. **Open RViz in a New Terminal**

   Open a new terminal and source both ROS 2 and your workspace:

   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
   source ~/clean_bot_ws/install/setup.bash
   rviz2
   ```

3. **Configure RViz**

   - Set the **Fixed Frame** to `base_link`
   - Click **Add** and include the following:
     - **TF** viewer
     - **RobotModel** viewer
   - Set the **Description Topic** of the Robot Model to `/robot_description`

## üìå Notes

- Always source both ROS 2 and your workspace in every new terminal.
- Cloning the repository inside the `src/` folder is required for `colcon` to detect and build it.
